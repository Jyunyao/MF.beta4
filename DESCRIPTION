Title: Measuring ecosystem multifunctionality and assessing BEF relationships
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Anne Chao, Chun-Yu Liu
Maintainer: Anne Chao <chao@stat.nthu.edu.tw>
Description: Provide simple functions to compute multifunctionality measures for a single and
       multiple ecosystems and plot for assessing the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF)
       relationships across scales. It was originally developed for the Beta4 project 
       (MÃ¼ller et al. 2022) on the effect of enhancing the beta diversity between forest patches
       on ecosystem multifunctionality and forest resilience across spatial scales. See 
       Chao et al.(2023) for pertinent methodology and decomposition theory.
