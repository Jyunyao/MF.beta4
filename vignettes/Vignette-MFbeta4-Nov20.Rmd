`MF.beta4` is an R package for measuring ecosystem multifunctionality and assessing BEF relationships. The measures are illustrated by using ecosystem function and biodiversity data collected in
a total of 209 plots in six European countries (the FunDivEUROPE dataset). All data are available
from the Dryad repository; see Ratcliffe et al. (2017b) and Scherer-Lorenzen et al. (2023) for details. The software was originally developed for the Beta4 project (Müller et al. 2022) on the effect
of enhancing the beta diversity between forest patches on ecosystem multifunctionality and forest
resilience across spatial scales.

Based on a framework of Hill-Chao numbers of orders q = 0, 1 and 2, `MF.beta4` features the following multifunctionality measures for a single and multiple ecosystems; see Chao et al. (2023) for
pertinent methodology and decomposition theory.



(1) <u>Multifunctionality measures in a single ecosystem:</u>  

`MF.beta4` computes a class of weighted
multifunctionality measures for given function weights. Multifunctionality measures that correct
for strong correlations between ecosystem functions to avoid redundancy are also provided.


(2) <u>Multifunctionality measures in multiple ecosystems:</u>

for given function weights, `MF.beta4` computes the gamma multifunctionality of pooled ecosystems, the within-ecosystem component (alpha
multifunctionality) and the among-ecosystem component (beta multifunctionality). The correlation between functions can also be corrected for.

\

Based on biodiversity and function data from ecosystems, this package also provides graphics for
assessing biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships across scales.

install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github("AnneChao/MF.beta4")

## import packages
library(MF.beta4)
```


This package includes four functions, as listed below with default arguments. See package manual for the detailed description of each argument.  

- **function_normalization**: transforms ecosystem function data to values between 0 and 1; other variables remain unchanged.

```{r eval=FALSE}
function_normalization(data, fun_cols = 1:ncol(data), negative = NULL, by_group = NULL) 
```

- **MF1_single**: computes multifunctionality measures of orders q = 0, 1 and 2 for given function weights in a single ecosystem separately for two cases: (i) correlations between functions are not corrected for, and (ii) correlations between functions are corrected for.

```{r eval=FALSE}
MF1_single(func_data, species_data = NULL, weight = 1, q = c(0, 1, 2))
```

- **MF2_multiple**:  computes alpha, beta and gamma multifuctionality measures of orders q = 0, 1 and 2 for given function weights in multiple ecosystems separately for two cases (i) correlations between functions are not corrected for, and (ii) correlations between functions are corrected for.


```{r eval=FALSE}
MF2_multiple(func_data, species_data = NULL, weight = 1, q = c(0, 1, 2), by_group = NULL) 
```

- **MFggplot**: provides the graphical BEF relationships based on the output obtained from the function `MF1_single` or `MF2_multiple`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
MFggplot(output, by_group = NULL, model = "LMM.both", caption = "slope")
```


## Data input format

#### Ecosystem function data


The FunDivEurope data are used here to demonstrate the use of the four functions; see Ratcliffe et al. (2017a, b) and Scherer-Lorenzen et al. (2023) for the original datasets. There are three datasets provided with the package: raw ecosystem function dataset (`forest_function_data_raw`), normalized function dataset (`forest_function_data_normalized`), and biodiversity dataset (`forest_biodiversity_data`). The first dataset includes the raw values of 26 ecosystem functions collected from 209 plots in six European countries, representing six major European forest types: boreal forest (Finland, 28 plots); hemi-boreal (Poland, 43 plots); temperate deciduous (Germany, 38 plots); mountainous deciduous (Romania, 28 plots); thermophilous deciduous (Italy, 36 plots); and Mediterranean mixed (Spain, 36 plots). Each plot is designated as an ecosystem in assessing BEF relationships. See Table 1 of Ratcliffe et al. (2017a) for a description of the 26 functions, and Ratcliffe et al. (2017a) and Scherer-Lorenzen et al. (2023) for data details of the original datasets. 

In addition to row name (plot/ecosystem id) and column name (plot information and function names), the data in the file  `forest_function_data_raw` are input as a data.frame with 209 plots (rows) and 32 columns. The first 5 columns show the relevant plot information, followed by 26 raw ecosystem functions. An additional column “country” for each plot is added (as the last column) because function normalization and relevant analyses will be performed within each country. For each missing value of functions in the original dataset, the mean of the given function within the country was imputed. Thus, the raw ecosystem function dataset provided with the package is slightly different from the original one. 


Run the following code for the data `forest_function_data_raw` to view the first ten rows and seven columns; columns 6 and 7 show respectively the first two raw ecosystem functions (earthworm_biomass and fine_woody_debris) :

```{r  fig.width=10, eval=FALSE}
data("forest_function_data_raw")
head(cbind(forest_function_data_raw[1:3], round(forest_function_data_raw[6:7], 3)), 10)
```

```{r  fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
data("forest_function_data_raw")
head(cbind(forest_function_data_raw[1:3], round(forest_function_data_raw[6:7], 3)), 10)
```

To meaningfully quantify multifunctionality in a ecosystem based on multiple functions, all function values should be first normalized to the range [0, 1]. Proper normalization can be performed by using `function_normalization` provided in the package. In the FunDivEUROPE data, the forests in the six countries represent different ecosystems, all functions were thus normalized within a country, by specifying the argument `by_group = "country"`. Because different transformations are applied to positive and negative functionality, it is required to specify negative functionality in the argument `"negative"`. In the raw function dataset, there are 26 ecosystem functions (column 6 to column 31). Among them, two are negative functionality: `"soil_cn_ff_10"` and `"wue"`, and others are positive functionality. Run the following code to view the first ten rows and seven columns; columns 6 and 7 show respectively the normalized values of the first two ecosystem functions (earthworm_biomass and fine_woody_debris):

```{r fig.width=10, eval=FALSE}
data("forest_function_data_raw")
normalized_forest_function_data <- function_normalization(data = forest_function_data_raw,
                    fun_cols = 6:31, negative = c("soil_cn_ff_10","wue"), by_group = "country")
head(cbind(normalized_forest_function_data[1:3], round(normalized_forest_function_data[6:7], 3)), 10)
```

```{r fig.width=10, echo=FALSE}
data("forest_function_data_raw")
normalized_forest_function_data <- function_normalization(data = forest_function_data_raw,
                    fun_cols = 6:31, negative = c("soil_cn_ff_10","wue"), by_group = "country")
head(cbind(normalized_forest_function_data[1:3], round(normalized_forest_function_data[6:7], 3)), 10)
```

This normalized dataset is exactly the same as the dataset `forest_function_data_normalized` provide with the package.


#### Biodiversity data

The `forest_biodiversity_data` consist of three columns: the "plotID" column includes the name of ecosystems/plots, the "species" column includes species names, and the "abundance" column includes the corresponding species abundance (basal area as a proxy of species abundance),in addition to row and column names; see Scherer-Lorenzen et al. (2023) for the original data. Because missing values of “basal area” in the original dataset were imputed by the mean of the same species within the country, and basal areas were combined for two species (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens), the dataset provided with the package is slightly different from the original dataset.

Run the following code to view the first ten rows of the biodiversity data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("forest_biodiversity_data")
head(forest_biodiversity_data,10)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
data("forest_biodiversity_data")
head(forest_biodiversity_data,10)
```

## Computing multifunctionality in a single ecosystem

Based on normalized function data, `MF1_single()` computes multifunctionality measures of orders q = 0, 1 and 2 for given function weights in a single ecosystem separately for two cases: (i) correlations between functions are not corrected for, and (ii) correlations between functions are corrected for. By default, `species_data = NULL` (i.e., biodiversity data are not provided). In this case, `MF1_single()` only computes multifunctionality measures of orders q = 0, 1 and 2 for each plot. Run the following code to view the first ten rows of the output:


```{r echo=TRUE}
data("forest_function_data_normalized")
single_without_species <- MF1_single(func_data = forest_function_data_normalized[,6:31],weight = 1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
single_without_species %>% mutate(qMF = round(qMF,3)) %>% as.data.frame() %>% head(10)
```


The above output includes the ID of plot (`plotID`), `Type` (uncorrected for correlations or corrected for correlations, which are denoted as corr_uncorrected and corr_corrected), the diversity order (`Order.q`) and the multifunctionality measure of order q (`qMF`). When biodiversity data are provided (`species_data = forest_biodiversity_data`), an additional column `Species.diversity` will be added; see the following output:

```{r echo=TRUE}
data("forest_function_data_normalized")
data("forest_biodiversity_data")
single_with_species <- MF1_single(func_data = forest_function_data_normalized[,6:31],weight = 1,
           species_data = forest_biodiversity_data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
single_with_species %>% mutate(qMF = round(qMF,3),
                          Species.diversity = round(Species.diversity,3)) %>% head(10)

```



## Computing alpha, beta and gamma multifunctionality for any pair of plots within a country

`MF2_multiple()` computes alpha, beta and gamma multifuctionality measures of orders q = 0, 1 and 2 for given function weights in multiple ecosystems separately for two cases: (i) correlations between functions are not corrected for, and (ii) correlations between functions are corrected for. The decomposition of mltifunctionality measure of order q is based on all pairs of plots separately within each country. The alpha scale refers to individual plots, whereas the gamma scale refers to the two collective plots. 

When `species_data = NULL` (i.e., biodiversity data are not provided),`MF2_multiple` computes alpha, beta, and gamma multifunctionality values for q = 0, 1 and 2 for all pairs of plots within each country. When biodiversity data are specified (`species_data = forest_biodiversity_data`), tree species diversity for q = 0, 1 and 2 are also computed. Run the following code to view the first ten rows of the output:


```{r eval=FALSE}
data("forest_function_data_normalized")
data("forest_biodiversity_data")
multiple_ecosystem = MF2_multiple(func_data = forest_function_data_normalized[,6:32],
                      species_data = forest_biodiversity_data,
                      weight = 1,
                      by_group = "country")
```

```{r include=FALSE}
data("forest_function_data_normalized")
data("forest_biodiversity_data")
forest_function_data_normalized <- forest_function_data_normalized %>% filter(country != "FIN")
forest_biodiversity_data <- forest_biodiversity_data[-(1:48),]
Demo_multiple = MF2_multiple(func_data =  forest_function_data_normalized[,6:32],
                      species_data = forest_biodiversity_data,
                      weight = 1,
                      by_group = "country")

multiple_ecosystem <- Demo_multiple %>%
  mutate(Type=factor(Type,levels = unique(Type)),
         Scale=factor(Scale,levels = unique(Scale))) %>%
  group_by(plotID,country,Type,Scale) %>%
  summarise(Order.q=Order.q,
            qMF=round(qMF,3),
            Species.diversity=round(Species.diversity,3))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
head(as.data.frame(multiple_ecosystem), 10)
multiple_ecosystem <- Demo_multiple
```


The above output includes the combinations of two plots (`plotID`), `Country` of the two plots, `Type` (uncorrected or corrected for correlations, which are denoted as corr_uncorrected and corr_corrected), `Scale` (gamma, alpha or beta), the diversity order (`Order.q`), multifunctionality value of order q (`qMF`) and the corresponding gamma/alpha/beta species diversity (`Species.diversity`).

NOTE: Because the total number of pair plots is huge for the whole data, it is very time consuming to obtain the output from running the above code. Users can simply select two countries (with 10 plots in each country) to promptly view the output; see the package manual for examples.



## Assessing BEF Relationships by MFggplot()

Function `MFggplot()` provides the graphical BEF relationships based on the output from the function
`MF1_single` or `MF2_multiple`.

#### Within-plot BEF relationship

For an <code>MF1_single</code> object of given individual function weights, this function plots the BEF relationship between multifunctionality of order q (= 0, 1 and 2) and species diversity of the same order
q for two cases: (i) correlations between functions are not corrected for. (ii) correlations between functions are corrected. The fitted lines for the chosen model are also shown in the figure.

Below we demonstrate how to reveal BEF relationships under the most useful linear mixed-effects model (`model = "LMM.both"`). Under the model, for each value of q, the relationship between tree species diversity and multifunctionality is modeled using a linear mixed-effects model with random slopes and random intercepts for each country. Run the following code to reveal the overall fixed-effect slopes (bold red lines) and each country’s relationships (thin lines) estimated from the same linear mixed model. All the fitted results and the associated test of significance for the overall slopes and R-squared were based on the output using the function “lmer” in the R packages “lme4” and “lmerTest”. 


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=6.5, fig.width=6.5}
single_with_species <- data.frame("plotID"=rownames(forest_function_data_raw),
                      "country"=forest_function_data_raw$country) %>%
  left_join(single_with_species,.,by="plotID")
MFggplot(single_with_species, model = "LMM.both", by_group = "country")
```

If `by_group = NULL`, one can only fit linear model (`model = "lm"`).


#### BEF relationships at gamma, alpha and beta scales

For an <code>MF2_multiple</code> object of given individual function weights, this function plots the BEF relationship between alpha/beta/gamma multifunctionality of order q (= 0, 1 and 2) and the corresponding alpha/beta/gamma species diversity of the same order q for two cases: (i) correlations between functions are not corrected for. (ii) correlations between functions are corrected. The fitted lines for the chosen model are also shown in the figure. 


By default, the BEF relationship for each scale is modeled using a linear mixed model with random slopes and random intercepts for each country. Run the following code to obtain the BEF graphical relationships when correlations are not corrected for.

Due to sparse data from Finland, data from Finland are excluded for following BEF figures.

```{r}
figure_LMM <- MFggplot(multiple_ecosystem, by_group = "country",  model = "LMM.both",caption = "slope")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=10, fig.width=6.5}
figure_LMM$corr_uncorrected$ALL
```


Then the BEF graphical relationships when correlations are corrected for are shown below. 

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=10, fig.width=6.5}
figure_LMM$corr_corrected$ALL
```

NOTE 1: Because the total number of pair plots is huge for the whole data, it is very time consuming to obtain the BEF graphical relationships from running the above code for alpha/beta/gamma scales. Users can simply select two countries (with 18 plots in each country) to promptly view the graphical results; see the package manual for examples.
